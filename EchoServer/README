This directory holds a new version of the Echo Server (called echo_service.jar) from the article here: http://support.cloudfoundry.com/entries/20485171-how-to-add-a-system-service-to-oss-cloud-foundry-step-by-step-guide.

I've updated the Echo Server so that it takes in both an ip address and a port so that the socket listens on that address/port combination.  The original version of the echo service always listened on 127.0.0.1. See corneliadavis.com blog for more details.
